# hello-world-python

This is my first Python project on GitHub!  
It simply prints `Hello, world!` to the screen.

## How to run it

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.  
Then run this command in your terminal:

```
python hello.py
```

## Why I made this

I'm learning Python and GitHub, and this is my very first step!
